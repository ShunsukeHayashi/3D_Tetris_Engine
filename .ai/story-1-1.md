# Story 1.1: Game Field Setup

## Status
- in-progress

## Overview
Implement the initial 3D game field so that the player sees a clearly defined play area consistent with the PRD and architecture guidelines.

## Objectives
- Visualize the 3D grid that represents the playfield volume.
- Highlight the boundaries (floor, walls, ceiling) with distinct visuals.
- Prepare hooks for future integration with GameState and Renderer modules.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define field dimensions and coordinate system shared across engine components.
- [ ] Create placeholder data structures representing the field grid cells.
- [ ] Initialize Three.js scene objects for floor, side walls, and back wall.
- [ ] Apply simple materials/lighting to distinguish playable boundaries.
- [ ] Ensure renderer resizes with window events without breaking the scene.
- [ ] Document public interfaces to be consumed by upcoming stories.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Launching the app shows a 3D scene with visible floor and boundary guides sized per project spec.
2. The field dimensions are defined in a reusable constants module for other stories.
3. Window resizing keeps the camera and renderer aligned without artifacts.
4. Basic code documentation/comments describe how other modules should interact with the field setup.

## Definition of Done
- Code adheres to repository TypeScript/ESLint standards (to be finalized later).
- Automated or manual validation steps are documented in @memory-bank.mdc.
- Story log updated and status reviewed with user.
- No TODO/FIXME comments remain in committed code.

## Dependencies
- .ai/prd.md (approved)
- .ai/arch.md (approved)

## Notes
- Further visual polish (lighting, textures) deferred to later epics.
- Input handling will be addressed in subsequent stories.
